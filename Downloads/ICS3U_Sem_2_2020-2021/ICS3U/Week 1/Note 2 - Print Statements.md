## Note â€“ Print Statements

### The Console

The **console**, also known as the output window, is the default location where text gets printed to.

In repl.it, the console is the black window on the right side of the screen.

### Hello World!

When using a programming language for the first time, it is traditional to run a program that prints "Hello World!".

The above image is an example of the Hello World program in Python using repl.it. When you hit *Run*, the text "Hello World!" is printed to the console. 

### print()

The most common function for printing in Python is `print()`. Anything you put inside the parentheses gets printed. If you are printing text, the text must be enclosed in double quotation marks `"`. If you want to print more than one thing with spaces in between, you can separate them with commas.

``` python
print(Hello World!) # this won't work because the quotation marks are missing
```

```python
print("Hello World!") # prints "Hello World!"
print("Hello", "World!") # also prints "Hello World!"
```
